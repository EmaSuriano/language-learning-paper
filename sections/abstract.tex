This Master's Thesis presents an innovative language learning system that integrates \gls{rl}, \gls{transformers} architectures, and \gls{rag} technologies to optimize the educational experience. The system implements a \gls{ppo} algorithm that dynamically adapts content according to the student's profile, generating personalized learning paths with accuracy exceeding 95%.

The integration of \gls{llm} models with voice processing (\gls{tts} and \gls{stt}) enables the creation of interactive dialogues and realistic conversational simulations, where students can simultaneously develop listening comprehension and oral production skills. The system's architecture is designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing the integration of new modules and functionalities.
